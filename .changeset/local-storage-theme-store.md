Add `localStorageThemeStore(storageKey)` for a theme store backed by localStorage for a fixed key. Refactor `getThemeFromLocalStorage`, `setThemeToLocalStorage`, and `observeThemeFromLocalStorage` to use the store internally. Export `LocalStorageThemeStore` and `LocalStorageThemeStoreOptions` types.

# AI Rules Master Reference

This file serves as the central reference for all AI rules in the repository.

## Table of Contents

- [How to Use](mdc:#how-to-use)
- [Locations](mdc:#locations)
- [Rule List](mdc:#rule-list)

## How to Use

Each rule may contain a section about related rules.
You should read the related rules before applying the rule.

## Locations

All rules should be located under folders `.cursor/rules`.
They can be placed at the root of the repository (i.e. `<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/.cursor/rules`),
or under the root of a project in a monorepo (e.g. `<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/.../<PROJECT_ROOT>/.cursor/rules`).

Other `*.mdc` files should not be treated as rule files unless explicitly referenced.

## Rule List

Rules are organized into three main categories:

- **Agents**: Control AI agent behavior and response formatting
- **Guidelines**: Establish best practices and coding standards
- **Workflows**: Provide step-by-step processes for specific tasks

### Agents

- [Commit Summary](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/commit-summary.mdc) - Add a "Commit Message" section in agent response
- [Cursor Rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/cursor-rules.mdc) - Rule for managing cursor rules
- [Rule Usage](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/rule-usage.mdc) - Add a "Rules Applied" section in agent response

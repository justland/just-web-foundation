# Cursor Rules Master Reference

This file serves as the central reference for all Cursor rules in the repository.

## Table of Contents

- [Available Rules](mdc:#available-rules)
- [Rule Categories](mdc:#rule-categories)
- [How to Use Rules](mdc:#how-to-use-rules)
- [Rule Organization](mdc:#rule-organization)

## Available Rules

All rules should be located under folders `.cursor/rules`.
They can be placed at the root of the repository (i.e. `<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/.cursor/rules`),
or under the root of a project in a monorepo (e.g. `<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/packages/<PROJECT_ROOT>/.cursor/rules`).

Other `*.mdc` files should not be treated as rule files unless referenced explicitly.

## How to Use Rules

### When to Apply Rules

- **Always**: Apply relevant rules when creating or modifying files
- **During Code Review**: Verify compliance with applicable rules
- **When Writing Documentation**: Follow markdown and naming guidelines
- **When Creating Components**: Follow JSX and Storybook guidelines

### Rule Application Process

1. **Identify Applicable Rules**: Determine which rules apply to your task
2. **Follow Guidelines**: Apply the specific guidance from each rule
3. **Validate Compliance**: Ensure your work meets all rule requirements
4. **Document Usage**: Mention which rules were applied in your response

## Rule Organization

Rules are organized into three main categories:

- **Agents**: Control AI agent behavior and response formatting
- **Guidelines**: Establish best practices and coding standards
- **Workflows**: Provide step-by-step processes for specific tasks

Each rule file follows a consistent structure with frontmatter, clear sections, and integration references.

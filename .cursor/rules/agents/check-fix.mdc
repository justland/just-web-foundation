# Check Fix Instructions

This rule ensures that after making code changes, the agent runs the `check:fix` script to fix any style errors (Biome lint/format).

## When to Apply This Rule

This rule should be applied in **EVERY** response involving code changes, including:

- Adding, modifying, or deleting source files
- Refactoring existing code
- Fixing bugs that require code edits
- Creating or updating components, hooks, utilities, or configuration

## How to Apply This Rule

1. **After completing code changes**: Before finalizing the response or generating a commit message, run the fix script
2. **Run from repository root**: Execute `pnpm run check:fix` from the project root
3. **Review auto-fixes**: If Biome fixes any issues, include those changes in the same session

## Command

```sh
pnpm run check:fix
```

This runs `biome check --fix` to automatically fix lint and format issues across the codebase.

## Enforcement

**This rule is MANDATORY - no exceptions.** If code was modified:

1. Run `pnpm run check:fix` before claiming the task is complete
2. Do not skip this step even for minimal changes
3. If the script reports errors it cannot auto-fix, address them and re-run

## Integration

This rule works in conjunction with:

- [commit-summary.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/agents/commit-summary.mdc) - Run check:fix before generating commit message
- [master.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/master.mdc) - For overall rule organization
